Q1 Answer- Version control, also known as source control or revision control, is a system that manages changes to a collection of files over time. 
It allows multiple contributors to work on a project simultaneously, tracks changes made to the files, and helps in coordinating collaborative development efforts.
The primary goal of version control is to keep track of the evolution of a project, maintain a history of changes, and facilitate collaboration among team members.

Here are key aspects of version control and its importance in software development:

1 History Tracking:
Version control systems (VCS) keep a historical record of changes made to files. This includes who made the changes, when they were made, and the nature of the changes. This history helps developers understand how the codebase has evolved over time.
2 Collaboration:
In a collaborative software development environment, multiple developers may work on different parts of a project simultaneously. Version control allows them to merge their changes seamlessly, preventing conflicts and ensuring that everyone is working with the latest version of the code.
3 Branching and Merging:
Version control systems support branching, which allows developers to create independent lines of development. This is useful for working on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Merging enables the integration of changes from one branch into another.
4 Risk Mitigation:
If an issue arises in the codebase, version control allows developers to roll back to a previous, stable state. This helps in quickly identifying and addressing problems, reducing the risk of introducing bugs into the production environment.
5 Traceability and Accountability:
Every change made to the codebase is logged with details about who made the change and when. This traceability is crucial for identifying the source of bugs, understanding the rationale behind certain decisions, and holding contributors accountable for their contributions
